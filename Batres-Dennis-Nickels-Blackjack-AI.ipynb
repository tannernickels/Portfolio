    "  In this project we aimed to design a series of programs using A.I. techniques to analyze various facets of the casino game Blackjack. The aspect of the game that interested us the most was the Blackjack strategy of card-counting, in which a player keeps track of the cards played to make better guesses about what moves to make in order to maximize profits. Furthermore, we wanted to see if there was a computational way for a third-party to watch a series of games and determine if a player was counting cards or not."

    "Initially, we intended to train a series of “players” using reinforcement learning and various learning heuristics to play the game. We defined these as random, basic, and counter, corresponding to random decision-making, established basic-strategy, and card-counting respectively. Then, we would attempt to run a linear regression on betting data for basic players in order to predict betting values to try and catch a player that is making decisions based off of card-counting. We hypothesized that random and basic players would converge on a similar playing style after training, but that their betting patterns would be significantly different than those of a player who is counting cards. To set up the problem, we first needed to research the game and the various strategies used for betting and gameplay, as well as the mechanics behind card-counting and the methods used by casinos to catch card-counters. \n"

    "Blackjack is a popular casino game offered in most casinos around the world. To start, you and the dealer are each dealt two cards with the object of the game being to beat the dealer. The goal is to receive cards from the dealer one at a time to get as close to 21 points without going over, also called “busting”. Each numbered card is counted at face-value, with face cards counted as 10, and the Ace counted as 1 or 11, depending on which is more beneficial to the player. When it is the player’s turn, they can either hit, stand, double-down, or split cards with the same value. For the purpose of this project, we decided to limit the player only to standing or hitting. While reducing player decisions in this fashion changed the odds of winning, it simplified the training and gameplay aspects of the game. We wanted to simplify the game as much as possible without making too many changes since we were unsure of the feasibility of incorporating all factors in the time allotted, and planned to add more factors to the game later if possible.  We also decided to use a soft-17 system of gameplay for the dealer, meaning the dealer will hit until they reach 17 or higher, with the Ace always being counted as 11 points. \n"

    "Since the popularization of card-counting in the 1960’s, casinos have made a concerted effort to discourage and prevent people from using the system. This mathematical strategy of gameplay is designed to give a player just enough of an edge over the casino that they could play the “house” for very large amounts of money. While not illegal, card-counting is highly frowned upon by casino management because of how much of an impact it can have on a player’s winnings. The system involves assigning “counts” to each card, then keeping track of a “running-count” for each card that gets dealt into play. By assigning positive values to low cards like 2 and 3, and negative values to higher cards like King and Ace, over time the running count can indicate whether there are more high cards or more low cards left in the deck, allowing a player to bet and play accordingly. When the count is higher than 5-7, there is a significant chance that they will be dealt blackjack on the next hand, which pays out 3-2, as opposed to the usual 1-1 for all other wins. This is the time when the player has the most edge over the casino. There are dozens of unique strategies that follow this principle, but for simplicity we mainly use the Hi-Lo system where values of -1, 0, and +1 are assigned to the cards. Once we had the parameters of gameplay set up, we were able to begin designing our programs.\n"

    "Reinforcement learning is a subdiscipline of machine learning that consists of training a program by the use of positive and negative reinforcements, which are added to a cumulative score to determine the total reward for a defined action. In game playing artificial intelligence, reinforcements are given with each successful outcome of a game, and a negative reinforcement is given with each loss. This data is stored in a Q table, a data structure consisting of state-move tuples as keys and the total reinforcement as the value. When training AI to play a game, the initial choices are made randomly to explore possible actions, and the reinforcement is adjusted based on whether those random actions were successful. "

    "The next step is decreasing the level of randomness for each iteration using a variable named `epsilon`, which changes at a rate of `epsilonDecayFactor`. The decision to make a random move or use previous knowledge is specified in an `epsilonGreedy` function, which generates a random value and compares it to `epsilon`. `epsilon` starts at `1.0`, meaning that 100% of the choices are random, and with each iteration it decays, eventually converging to `0`. By that time, the goal of the program is to have enough data on previous games in the Q table to completely base its decisions off of previous knowledge. By having explored multiple options it is able to correctly choose the one which will result in a higher reward. The reward is directly influenced by a variable `learningRate`, which specifies how much of a reinforcement you are adding every time. "

    "For the game of blackjack, we chose to use reinforcement learning because each hand has only 3 possible outcomes: win, draw, or loss. The idea of using reinforcement learning for this game is simple: the state is represented as a player’s hand and the move is either `Hit` or `Stand`. If this choice results in a win, we give a positive reinforcement to the player, and if they lose, we give a negative reinforcement. Since the game is partially based on luck of which cards you were handed, we base our reinforcement off the player’s decision to hit or stand. That way, after playing enough games a player will know when to hit or stand to avoid busting, or hitting a total hand value over the limit of 21. We then use various betting strategies to optimize a player’s reward after winning a game."

    "In the game, there is a term known as a “bet spread”, corresponding to the table-minimum bet and the maximum bet a player is willing to put down. We set this to be around 10-50. Using a smaller bet spread for each player results in all players appearing indistinguishable from one another during gameplay. However, the players would be allowed to go beyond the bet spread at different times to account for a human-factor of betting known as the Gambler’s Fallacy. This is a cognitive bias in which players bet more money if they win more games, despite the fact that games are statistically independent from each other...unless you’re counting cards. Thus, we end up with players that generally bet within a given range, deviating at times if they’re winning more or if they’re counting cards.

The basic player uses a progressive betting system where the bet is increased by a small amount every time the player wins, and decreased every time they lose, only deviating from the bet spread if they win many games in a small span. Finally, the counter places bets based off the count of the table, also incorporating bet spread, betting spikes, and penetration depending on the technique.

We adjusted this code to include additional information and methods required for Blackjack, such as card counts, busting, and multiple decks. The `Card` object was left unchanged. The `Deck` object was changed to keep a running count of cards which is used by card counting players to base their bets off of. This allows card counters to easily access the true count of the cards in play without keeping score in their hand, which is reset every time a game is over and new cards are dealt. The `Hand` object includes additional methods to test whether or not a player has busted, and if they have a blackjack, which involves modifying the value of aces to be 1 or 11 as needed.\n"

Additionally, the counter was given a slight edge, since some hands in basic strategy (in actual card-counting there are 18 hands), require you to deviate from basic for better odds. In these few cases (for us, 10, since we don’t double down or split) the counter will deviate."

    "An interesting observation in our training results is that all types of players converged on similar values, and these values accurately reflect the true odds of blackjack. In a game of blackjack, it is expected that players win about 42.22% of the time, draw about 8.48%, and lose about 49.10%, before incorporating splitting and doubling down. Our players converged on values within only a few percent of the expected values, supporting our initial hypothesis that random and basic players will end up being the same. What surprised us is that the counter player also converged close to these values, indicating that our training could have likely been accomplished with only one `basicGreedy` function."

This allows us to handle a player’s decisions before they use their Q tables and eventually converge on similar values.

    "As far as actually using the Q-tables in gameplay, we needed a way to avoid training a player every time we wanted them to play games. Due to the complexity of the game and the various possible states, we needed to train each player for enough iterations to make sure they saw enough states. The states we really cared about were the ones containing 0-2 Aces, since anything more than that is uncommon enough that it didn’t matter much. This lead to about 23*2*3 = 138 (hands*hit/stand*1-2 Aces) different states that we wanted to catch. To accomplish this, we ran every player with 10,000 iterations, then saved their Q-tables as a .json file that could easily be read into a dictionary when we wanted to run each player. "

    "The penetration, camo, and all-in bets are a bit more sophisticated, all designed to conceal the counters intentions from the casino. The term penetration in blackjack refers to how deep into the “shoe” the cards have been dealt, where the shoe is the shuffled combination of all decks being used. For a 6-deck game, which is what we use, the shoe contains up to 6 decks at a time. As the shoe becomes more penetrated, the true count of the table becomes more informative for the counter. We found a good penetration value to be `0.6`, meaning 60% of the cards in the shoe have been dealt out already. The player uses the same progressive betting pattern as the basic player, all the while maintaining the count of the deck, until the shoe has been penetrated far enough. It then begins using the basic counter bet mentioned previously to make decisions off the count. In a real-life game, players can see the discard tray used by the dealer allowing them to estimate the penetration, so it wasn’t unreasonable for us to provide this information to the player. This betting scheme hides the correlation between a player’s bets and the table count, since 60% of the game will be played without the count."

    "Lastly, the all-in bet is the closest thing to gambling that the counter does. It is not uncommon in casino games for players to bet the rest of their bankroll (a term used to describe the amount of money a player is willing to spend over the course of N-games) on the last round of a game before going home. This type of activity will always be seen as a spike, but casinos will tend to ignore it if the player leaves the table afterwards. The all-in counter uses penetration to wait for 75% of the shoe to be dealt into play. In the event that the shoe is 75% penetrated and the table count goes above 7, the counter will bet half their bankroll, which we have allotted at $100,000, then they will leave the table. If those conditions are not met, they play the same as a basic player, never playing off the table count. This allows a counter one chance to win big, since a high count indicates a good chance of getting blackjack, and over 100 games they will walk out with big winnings."

Only some of this data is used in analysis, while all of it was used for our own purposes to see what our players were doing.

Because of the definition of a spike, this is the most important factor. Then it checks if the last game was won or not, allowing players to spike if they won the last game. If both of these checks fail, it does one last check of the table count. If the table count is above 2, a flag is thrown. We added this final check because the whole point of this is to keep players from making money. If a player spikes and their betting is correlated with the count, we only really care when the count is high enough to hurt the casino. This could be modified for any constraints though, disregarding the table count and throwing a flag any time someone deviates from their bet too much."

We calculated performance off of a Win/Loss/Bust/Draw ratio as well as the final balance in each player’s bankroll. In order to get a good sample size we ran 100 games over 100 iterations for each player to get 10,000 total games, averaging everything at the end. This way, we still got a good volume of games to analyze, but all of our numbers came out neatly out of 100. Our final results for each player were as follows:"

Our counters that attempted to hide from the casino did so at the expense of not making as much money, which is a fantastic result.

While the results posted in this notebook indicate that this was the case for some counters, all of them were trained the same, so we would have expected less variation. We believe that better training values over more iterations, with more than 10,000 games played might have made this a bit better. However, we may have just ended up with the same results anyways. Again, we ran out of time to start messing around with the training that we felt it best to just leave it."

    "Another way we would have liked to improve this project would be to run our betting analysis as an A.I. rather than a script, training it on data from various games. This way it might be better at catching the counter quicker, and ignoring insignificant players. Better yet, if we trained it on camouflaged players, we believe that eventually it would be able to catch even people trying to hide from the casino. The last step we might add to this is to run both A.I.’s one-on-one, training each other as they go until the point where either counters are indistinguishable from normal players, or the analysis A.I can catch anybody who is counting regardless of how they play."

    "Unfortunately, all of this seems like a pipe dream. While we believe it could be useful if improved upon, we did some research into how casinos catch card-counters. It would seem that human factors and simply imposing rules on the game are effective enough to catch counters. Some of the human factors used by casinos involve watching the player’s actions: whether they’re signaling teammates, waiting to enter a game until the shoe is penetrated, even what they’re drinking, as alcohol (or lack thereof) can be an indicator that someone is counting. Furthermore, it seems easier to just impose rules on the game that make it impractical to count cards. The two biggest things a casino may do are maintaining a constant 6-deck shoe, always replenishing it with new decks, and forbidding mid-shoe play, making penetration betting impossible. "

    "So at the end of the day, it would seem that all of this just wouldn’t be used by a real casino. Especially since that would require the addition of computer vision to actually look at the cards on the table and maintain a running count as well as the player bets. Fortunately, this is exactly the type of program that could be employed by online and electronic gambling, where players flagged as counters get suspended from their accounts for X amount of time. Regardless of the usefulness of the software, it was still a valuable learning experience for our team, and if anything came out of it, now we all know how to count cards and beat the casino!"
